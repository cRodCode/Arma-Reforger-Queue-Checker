# Arma-Reforger-Queue-Checker
This is a Arma Reforger queue checker that notifies you via email when you're in-game and optionally in queue position 1-10. This project was initially created for the Narcos Life RP server but can be modified to support other servers.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This project was inpired by the long wait times in queue for this game and espcially this server. I always debated going out to a cafe while I waited which pushed me to implement some sort of notification system. This works by using image detection to check queue position and in-game notifications.

- Once the program is running update your email by typing it out in the entry box and pressing the save button.
- Now select which queue position you'd like to be notified at if any.
